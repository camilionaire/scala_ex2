Exercise 2:

a) <xc> <yc> AND <xc> NOT OR
b) <xc> <yc> AND <xc> NOT <yc> NOT AND OR
c) <xc> <yc> NOT AND <xc> NOT <yc> AND OR

So, some comments on the exercise.  I think I finally have my env set up
which is good.  I did add an XOR to the STACKM0.scala file.  I wasn't sure
how to add in the code to the BLComp file for the xor expression without it.
I did a lot of commenting in the files / methods as well just to help
understand what was going on with everything.
